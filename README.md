# measurement-scheduling0
This repository is meant to house some of the ideas from the joint project between Prof. Ozay (University of Michigan) and Prof. Jungers (UniversitÃ© catholique de Louvain) about scheduling measurements for a linear system.)

## Running Experiments
To run an experiment (e.g. Experiment 1), the user should need to only type the following command:

> results = run_ms_experiments(1)

If you run the command and it fails, then it is likely that either (a) you do not have the proper libraries included (like tbxmanager) or (b) the experiment is not contained in the experiments folder.
